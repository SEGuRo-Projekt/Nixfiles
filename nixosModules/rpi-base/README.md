# Raspberry Pi Shared Base Configuration

This configuration assumes:
- The SD card is partitioned like the nixos-aarch64-install-image.
- All files in on the SD card are world readable.
- The rootfs is a tmpfs build up from bind mounts and symlinks to persistent storage.
- RPIBOOT verifies and boots our uboot using the RPi 4Bs secure boot feature.
- Our uboot uses the tpm2 to verify the rest of the boot chain.

The rough idea is based on the [description] and [howto] for the secureboot feature,
as well as the integration of a TPM into the boot process outlined in [rpi4-uboot-tpm].

## TODO

- Evaluate where in the `secrets.nix` a value of `allSystems` is acceptable as breaching a single machine compromises a secret used by many others.
- The secret key should be created on the LUKS volume and should thus guarded by our TPM.


## Building our own image with firmware for secureboot

- Use the [sd-image.nix] module from nixpkgs for the basic image generation.
- Override the [ubootRaspberryPi4_64bit] derivation with a custom defconfig that enables tpm2 support.
- Generate our own firmware partition contents similar to [sd-image-aarch64.nix]. (custom `config.txt` + our modified uboot)
- Our /nix and /boot directories stay unencrypted on the sd-card.
- Copy and modify the [enpandOnBoot] code to ...
  - ... only grow root to a specific size (e.g. 20GB TBD)
  - ... add another new LUKS encrypted partition with a key derived from the TPM2 for secrets and logs.
